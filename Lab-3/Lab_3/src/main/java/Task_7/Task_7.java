* Seminar 3 - Task 7 Print selected words from BST
* @author Alexander Lundqvist
* Created: 30-09-2021
*
* Write a program based on a Binary Search Tree which reads the first two 
* hundred words from the text and allows the user to select to print these 
* words in either alphabetic or reverse alphabetic order. The printing of the 
* content of the tree should be done in a method while traversing the tree. 
* The time complexity of the printing should be O(N) where N is the number of 
* different words in the text and the memory complexity should be O(log(N)) 
* assuming the tree is balanced.
