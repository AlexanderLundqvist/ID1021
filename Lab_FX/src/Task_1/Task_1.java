* Seminar FX - Task 1
* @author Alexander Lundqvist
* Created: 07-10-2021
*
* About this class:
*
*
* Based on:
* <a href="">Link</a>
*
* 
* Implement a double linked list with a sentinel element. The API should have methods to:
* i) A method to create a new list instantiated with some type of elements 
* (data stored in the list) defined at the time the list is created
* ii) A method to insert an element at the beginning of the list 
* iii) A method to insert an element at the end of the list 
* iv) A method to remove and return the first element in the list
* v) A method to remove and return the last element of the list
* vi) A method to insert elements ordered in ascending order in the list
* vii) You should calculate the Big-Oh complexities for insertion and removal of elements
* Limitations: You are not allowed to use extra references such as first/last to keep track of 
* where the list starts/ends. The total amount of lines of executable code 
* (statements such as if, for, while, new, method calls and assignments) for 
* the methods i - vi, should be 20-40 lines including lines of executable code 
* in methods called. This requires careful design of the methods and 
* "helper" methods.
