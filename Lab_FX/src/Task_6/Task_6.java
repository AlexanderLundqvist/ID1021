* About this class:
*
*
* Based on:
* <a href="">Link</a>
*
* Implement a program which allows the user to find the shortest path between 
* two nodes in a directed graph with edge weights, possibly passing through a 
* third node. I.e. the user should be able to ask questions like:
* Which is the shortest path from A to B passing through C? 
* The program should output an ordered list of the nodes to traverse from A to B 
* if such a path exists. If no such path exists then the program should output 
* that no such path exists.
* Use NYC.txt as input when not executing tests (in the case that the tests 
* should be executed you may use another input). This is the undirected road 
* network of New York City. The graph contains 264346 vertices and 733846 edges. 
* It is connected, contains parallel edges, but no self-loops. The edge weights 
* are travel times and are strictly positive. You should also calculate/show 
* the time complexity of your algorithm.
* This assignment requires that you study material on edge weighted graphs in the book. 
* (the algorithm is used in routing in the Internet, i.e. it is useful to know)
