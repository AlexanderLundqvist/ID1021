* About this class:
*
*
* Based on:
* <a href="">Link</a>
*
* Implement a program which reads an ASCII text file whose name is given as an 
* argument at the command line. The text file should contain a text written in 
* English which may contain misspellings of words. The program should output a 
* corrected version of the text, basing the corrections on the list of common 
* misspellings found here: 
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Lists_of_common_misspellings/For_machines
* The execution time complexity should be near linear compared to the time it 
* takes to read the input files. That is, you need to show that your algorithm 
* meets this constraint.
* For this assignment you may use the abstract data types defined in the course 
* directly (i.e. you need not implement them yourself)
